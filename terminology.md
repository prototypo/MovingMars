TODO :) Basque is an extremely difficult language to learn because it is so different from most other languages. I chose this language and culture for the Founder specifically because of the isolation and difference.


# Notes

Dunbars are named after the work by British anthropologist [Robin Dunbar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Dunbar).

Dunbar families live in a single room. Single adults share a room with other single adults. Bedding is stored under the floor when not being used. There is a communal kitchen for each dunbar. Each dunbar has a neighbourhood priest as overseer. Each dunbar is assigned a communal task, such as working a factory, a farm, or a part of a larger business.

Dunbars are capped at 150 people. In the past, a dunbar would split when it exceeded its population limit. However, new population controls were eventually introduced to maintain a dunbar so that it would not be allowed to grow. Allowance for a new baby is issued by the local temple when a member dies, and allocated by a dunbar to a set of parents by the neighbourhood priest, or communal consent, depending on how the dunbar is run. Unapproved babies that cause a dunbar to exceed its population quota cause immediate and non-appealable banishment of both parents and child. They are left to make their way on their own, if they can.

Neighbourhood priests wear taupe robes, and shave their heads. They are addressed as "Elder", and generally are old men and women. It is considered a retirement job for long service to the Eliza.

Multiple dunbars meet weekly in a temple. There they are instructed by pulpiteers. Pulpiteers wear yellow robes, and are assisted by coadjutors who wear taupe robes. Pulpiteers and coadjutors shave their heads.

An ecclesical runs a sanctuary. They are sort of big temples, and used as regional headquarters for the Eliza. Ecclesicals wear purple robes and have hair.
